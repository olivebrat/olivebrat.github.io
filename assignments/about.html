        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          My dream is that this Programing 109 class is just the beginning for me. I currently have the motivation to move onto bigger things. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My dream may be far fetched but, this introduction to programing his renewed a interest in Artificial Intelligence. My goal for after this program is to learn python and later apply that python to machine learning. By 2020 the projected job market growth in AI is expected to increase by 2.3 million. I intend to be one of the 2.3 million + in the next four years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previous to being in YearUp I was in a rut. I am the sort of person who always needs progression. Now I am finally in a mentality where I can achieve my ambitions. I feel happy and satisfied.
